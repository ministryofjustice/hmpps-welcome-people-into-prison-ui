            <p>This accessibility statement applies to the Welcome people into prison service, available at: 
                <a  class="govuk-link" href="{{ wpipLink }}" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">{{ wpipLink }}</a>

                Welcome people into prison is run by HMPPS. We want as many people as possible to be able to use it. 
                That means you should be able to:
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
                    <li>zoom in up to 120% without problems</li>
                    <li>get from the start of the service to the end using just a keyboard</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>We have also made the text in the service as simple as possible to understand.</p>

                    <li>some links don’t make it clear about where they will take the user to</li>
                    <li>some images are missing alt text that correctly describe what the image is conveying</li>
